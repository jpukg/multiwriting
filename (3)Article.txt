President Trump faced an old problem. Some people said some products made
in foreign countries were better and cheaper than goods made in America.

The easy solution is to make better and cheaper products in this country.
That part is not so easy. America is a mature economy. Its equipment may be older.
Its workers earn more money. Emerging economies saw their chance.
Build new factories. Hire lower paid workers. For the last thirty years,
foreign companies have made fortunes doing just that.
